# transformer_helpers.py

The helpers in this file simplify common tasks when working with Hugging Face transformers for natural language
processing.

## Utilities

- **`load_model_and_tokenizer`** – downloads a pretrained causal language model and its tokenizer.
- **`generate_text`** – feeds a prompt into the model and returns the generated continuation. Uses PyTorch tensors under
the hood.
- **`text_generation_pipeline`** – convenience wrapper that constructs a pipeline object for immediate generation.
- **`fine_tune_text_classification`** – shows how to fine-tune a transformer on a text classification task with the
  `Trainer` API.

## Python Syntax

Transformers are loaded via class methods like `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained`. Data is tokenized with
`tokenizer(prompt, return_tensors="pt")` to produce PyTorch tensors. The `TrainingArguments` class configures the
details of training such as output directory and number of epochs.

## Theory

Transformer architectures rely on self-attention to process sequences in parallel and capture long-range dependencies.
Fine-tuning allows a pretrained model to adapt to a new dataset with relatively little data by updating its weights from
a pre-initialized state. Text generation uses the model to autoregressively predict subsequent tokens given a prompt.

Self-attention computes pairwise interactions between all positions in a
sequence, enabling the model to weigh the relevance of words regardless of their
distance. Stacking multiple attention layers yields powerful contextual
representations. Transformers eschew recurrence entirely, allowing them to be
parallelized efficiently on modern hardware while still modelling complex
relationships within text.
