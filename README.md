# Python Templates for General Purpose, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning

Welcome to my collection of Python templates! 
This repository is designed to serve as a comprehensive 
resource for developers, data scientists, and researchers 
interested in Python programming for general-purpose tasks, 
machine learning, and deep learning projects. 
Whether you're a beginner looking to learn or an experienced 
professional seeking to streamline your workflow, you'll find a 
variety of templates to suit your needs.

I hope you find this as useful as I do.

## Introduction

This repository aims to provide a wide range of Python templates covering various domains, including data preprocessing, model building, visualization, automation scripts, and more. Our goal is to help you kick-start your projects by reducing the initial setup time and providing well-documented, easy-to-understand code examples.

## Getting Started

To get started with these templates, clone this repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/CodeHalwell/Useful_Scripts.git
Navigate to the desired template directory, and refer to the specific README.md file (if available) for detailed instructions on requirements and usage.
```

## Repository Structure
This repository is organized into three main sections:

general: Contains templates for general programming tasks such as file operations, data manipulation, and automation scripts.

machine_learning: Includes templates for various stages of machine learning projects, such as data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and deployment.

deep_learning: Features templates for deep learning projects using popular frameworks like TensorFlow and PyTorch, covering tasks from simple neural networks to complex architectures.
Each section contains subdirectories for specific templates, along with a README.md file providing details about the template, including its purpose, usage, and required libraries.

### General Purpose Scripts

In the `general` directory, you'll find templates for everyday programming tasks that can help you automate workflows, process data, and more. Examples include:

* CSV file manipulation
* Web scraping
* Batch renaming of files
* Utility helpers for setting random seeds, downloading files and timing code
* Common DataFrame operations and visualisation helpers

### Machine Learning Templates
The machine_learning directory offers templates for various components of machine learning projects, including:

* Data cleaning and preprocessing
* Feature selection and engineering
* Model training and evaluation
* Model deployment

### Deep Learning Templates
Our deep_learning section includes templates designed for neural network projects, with examples for:

* Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) including simple ResNet examples
* Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs, LSTMs, and GRUs) for sequence modeling
* Transformer utilities for working with large language models and fine-tuning
* Graph Neural Networks (GCN, GAT, and GraphSAGE layers)
* Reinforcement learning helpers from Q-learning to DQN
* Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for image generation

### How to Use the Templates
Each template is designed to be self-contained and reusable. To use a template:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the template's directory.
3. Install any required dependencies specified in the template's README.md.
4. Adapt the template code to fit your specific project requirements.
